# schools-api (work in progress)
A free list of all schools and school districts in the United States of America

## Purpose
In another project that I am currently working on, I came across the need for every school district and school in each school district. In my searching, I could not find any concise list or API of what exactly I needed. I did come across a www.schooldigger.com though. However, I do not fancy paying $19.99 a month to use it in my project. 

So, this lead me here. I am going to attempt to take my little knowledge about python and attempt to create a web scraper that will take data from the National Education Statistics Center website and put it all into a JSON file that can easily be used. The crazy thing though is that schooldigger.com is offering essentially the same information the NCES is offering. Maybe they used a scraper and are upselling it? Who knows.

I know this super niche, but I hope that, once finished, I can save someone $19.99 a month.
